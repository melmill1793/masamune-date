<main><p>Welcome to <em>The Rise of the One-Eyed Dragon</em>! The purpose of this site is to give you some basic information on Masamune Date, one of my favorite historical figures and someone I view as a hero. Masamune had a rough life, but he didn't give up on his dreams - what might have happened if he did? For example, the capital city of Miyagi Prefecture, Sendai, might not exist.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy learning about Masamune as much as I did!</p>
