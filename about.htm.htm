<main><strong>Masamune Date</strong> was born September 5, 1567 in Yonezawa, Yamagata, Japan and was a regional strongman of Japan's Azuchi-Momoyama (1568/1573 to 1600) period through early Edo period (1603 to 1868). Heir to a long line of powerful daimyo (feudal lords) in the Tohoku region (northeastern Honshu), he founded the modern-day city of Sendai.

<p>Masamune was an outstanding tactician and was often called the "one-eyed dragon" due to his missing right eye. Masamune lost his right eye when he was a child after acquiring smallpox. No one knows for certain how his eye came out - some sources say that Masamune removed the eye himself so an enemy couldn't grab it during a fight, others say he had his retainer Kojuro Katakura remove it for him.</p>
