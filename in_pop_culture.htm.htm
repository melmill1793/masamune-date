<main><p>Masamune is a playable character in the Samurai Warriors series of video-games. In the first game, he is 4'7" and only 14 years old. He was designed to be the "gutsy boy" and "spoiled brat" and ambitious but not too deadly. He fights with two wooden swords jokingly chosen for originality and to avoid the ethical issue of a child killing/being killed.</p>

<p>He is an impulsive leader and thinks he's better than everyone else, calling people fools and other similar words. He is an independent thinker, but he does listen to the advice of his "right eye" Kojuro.</p>

<p>On the outside he acts like a tough guy, but deep down he appreciates other people's praises, though he shows his appreciation by yelling insults or being mean.</p>

<p>In the first Samurai Warriors game, Masamune's desire for power and respect blinds him to everything else, but he genuinely cares about the future of Japan. In order to keep his ambitions alive, he bows down to others when it is necessary (e.g. Hideyoshi Hashiba, also known as Hideyoshi Toyotomi).</p>

<p>In Samurai Warriors 2 and future games, he is 5'9" but his age is unknown. He has a new design aimed to recreate his historical nickname as a Datemono (a man of the date or a dandy man).</p>

<p>In Samurai Warriors 4, his design was changed so he would seem mature. He regards Kojuro as his living shadow and he can't think about a life without him. Masamune and Kojuro don't always get along, but Masamune sincerely appreciates Kojuro's loyalty.</p>

<p>Masamune regrets missing his chance to unite Japan, but surviving is important to him and he sees it as a way of respecting the dead. In this game and its prequel, Masamune has a hard time dealing with his father's death.</p>

<p>In newer games, Masamune is good friends with Magoichi Saika - they both love money and view firearms as the weapons of the future.</p>

<p>Masamune even appears in one of the Pok&eacute;mon games, Pok&eacute;mon Conquest, also known as Pok&eacute;mon + Nobunaga's Ambition. In that game, Masamune is in a land similar to Japan, but it's called Ransei. He is one of the characters the player must battle to unite the land and see the legendary Pok&eacute;mon Arceus, said to be the creator of the land.</p>
