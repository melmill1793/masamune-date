# masamune-date
This is an improved version of an assignment for my CIS 110 class. The topic is Masamune Date, a Japanese historical figure.
It needed to have 3 to 4 pages and at least two of them were to have clipart, multimedia, video, etc. Each page needed to have a heading/title, paragraph(s) describing important information, and a photo (if applicable). It also had to be easy to navigate.

I mainly used the Koei wiki and Wikipedia for my information.
